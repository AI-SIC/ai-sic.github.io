For now, you can find the abstract of the talk here.\n\nAbstract\nSelecting an appropriate measurement instrument in social science survey research presents researchers with a fundamental trade-off between depth and scalability. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their diverse applications and enhanced user-friendliness, opens new possibilities for social science research methodology. While recent research has primarily focused on whether LLMs can replace human respondents through so-called silicon samples, less attention has been paid to their potential to also replace interviewers. Early findings suggest that AI interviewers can surpass humans in specific tasks, such as active listening, while also reducing biases resulting from reactivity and social desirability effects, but their capabilities remain underexplored.\nOur study takes a novel approach: simulating AI-AI interactions, where LLMs act as both interviewers and respondents in semi-structured interview settings. This dual-simulation framework enables us to rigorously test and refine interviewing methodologies while addressing the dynamic nature of human interactions, which are inherently unpredictable and context-dependent. As a test case, we simulate interviews with children—a particularly challenging context that demands empathetic and adaptive interviewing techniques. By adhering to established guidelines for interviewing children, we evaluate LLMs on their ability to generate dynamic follow-up questions, maintain conversational flow, and exhibit algorithmic fidelity in both roles, modeling complex human interactions.\nBeyond addressing common methodological challenges, such as social desirability biases and subjective inconsistencies, our framework offers a scalable solution for testing and refining interview methodologies. Generating ‘silicon interviews’, enables the development and refinement of downstream tasks, such as computational coding and analysis, by providing more robust large-scale datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of AI-driven simulations to advance survey research by bridging methodological gaps, reducing costs, and enhancing the scalability of interview-based research, thereby easing the trade-off between large-scale surveys and semi-structured interviews."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Planned talk for the ESRA Conference. Shortly, we will publish an article related to our research. For now, you can find the abstract of the talk here.\n\nAbstract\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an essential technology for automating the transcription of qualitative data in social science research, particularly with large interview datasets. Recent advancements in ASR have introduced powerful new tools to the field, but their implementation requires careful and thoughtful consideration to ensure reliability and accuracy. Since outcomes vary significantly depending on the model and its (hyper-)parametrization, it is crucial to evaluate the generalization capabilities of ASR models on specific research data using a meaningful and comparable metric. Addressing these challenges will enable social scientists to effectively leverage these technologies in their research.\nThe most commonly used metric for this purpose is the Word Error Rate (WER). WER depends on specific language-specific text transformations and focuses on surface-level accuracy, making it inadequate for evaluating transcript quality in social sciences and downstream NLP tasks. To address limitations, modern, semantics-oriented metrics have been developed in recent years. Metrics such as Embedding Error Rate (EmbER) and Semantic-WER apply penalties for different types of errors, while methods like BERTScore, SeMaScore, SemDist, and Aligned Semantic Distance (ASD) improve evaluation by utilizing contextual embeddings and advanced matching techniques to assess semantic similarity.\nOur research centers on comparing the usability of these semantic metrics for ASR in social sciences and developing a more intuitive approach for analyzing semantic differences in ASR transcriptions using aligned window-based semantic comparison, as opposed to relying on traditional singular value metrics. The proposed talk is not only designed to improve the quality of individual research projects but also to contribute to the creation of new data spaces for the social sciences, where ASR is a fundamental technology. Only when developing robust methods for evaluating and utilizing ASR, we can unlock the potential of large-scale qualitative datasets, opening up new avenues for research and analysis."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nTo ensure the quality of survey research, survey instruments are validated using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Both approaches, however, come with limitations. While quantitative analyses can reveal efficiently generalizable relationships between different concepts and systematic differences between respondents due to large sample sizes, they are limited in their ability to capture complex cognitive processes within individuals.\nIn contrast to quantitative methods, qualitative approaches such as semi-structured cognitive interviews provide deeper insights into participants’ thought patterns. However, the high cost of such studies often limits sample size and scalability, which affects general validity, generalizability, and the ability to account for differences between subgroups.\nIntegrating the strengths of both methods can significantly improve survey research by enabling a holistic understanding of phenomena while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of quantitative validation. However, combining both approaches presents a challenge.\nThe AI-SIC project contributes by developing an AI-based approach for semi-automatic coding using an active learning strategy. This involves combining machine coding algorithms with human coding skills. Furthermore, new methods are applied to efficiently and thoroughly validate survey instruments in order to address research gaps concerning the already established measurement of self-rated health. This will help to close the gap between qualitative and quantitative methods and answer open questions about how children and their parents assess the health of children."

The goal is to combine machine coding algorithms with human inductive coding skills to increase efficiency in coding extensive qualitative interview data.\nThe second work package “Application and Evaluation of InTraCo” (Dr. Andreas Niekler & Stephan Poppe; University of Leipzig) is dedicated to the application of the newly developed approach as well as its validation and adaptation.\nThe third work package “Exploring the self- and proxy-assessment strategies of children and parents” (Dr. Jacqueline Kroh; LIfBi) utilizes the highly complex data obtained and examines whether the new method can provide added value for content-related analyses using machine learning procedures. This is intended to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how both children and parents assess children’s health.\nThe fourth work package “Comparability of assessment strategies and results between self- and proxy-assessments of children and parents” (Prof. Dr. Julia Offenhammer-Tuppat; University of Leipzig) deepens the insights gained in work package three and investigates similarities and differences between various respondent groups in the children’s self-assessments and the parents’ proxy assessments of child health."
